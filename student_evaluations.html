          <p style="font-size:20px;">UC Davis students evaluate teaching assistants (TAs) on 5 qualities, each on a 5-point Likert scale. They can also optionally write an open-ended comment about their TAs (see below for some samples)</p>
          <p style="font-size:20px;">So far, I have taught 324 students across 6 terms, with 127 students opting to fill out evaluations (39.20%). <b style="color:red;">My average rating</b> across all students and questions <b style="color:red;">is 4.55 out of 5 (between "very good" and "excellent").</b></p>
